We are at a unique moment in human history where we are witnessing the near-simultaneous confluence of the following 5 developments:

1. Templatization of the foundation models paradigm in AI
2. Near ubiquitous penetration of smartphones (the last billion populace)
3. The rise and rise of low-cost wearables laden with high sampling rate motion sensor triad (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer)
4. Commodification and off-the-shelf availability of high accuracy pose models that run even on low-end sub-$100 Android devices (Think of BlazePose/GHUM + Media Pipe for example)
5. Maturing of the low-power, low-latency, always-on and on-device machine learning tech

Anyone with an access to a smartphone and a wearable can generated highly granular multi-modal visio-motion data that can then be harnessed
